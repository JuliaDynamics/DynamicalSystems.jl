The package DynamicalSystems.jl does not have any actual code.
It re-exports other packages (see [docs](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystems.jl/dev/#Getting-started). As a result it has no real changelog and one should see the individual packages' changelogs.

# Major release notes
For reference, version listing of DynamicalSystems.jl v3.0 is at the end.

## New package StateSpaceSets.jl
It has all functionality surrounding `Dataset` and similar types. It therefore detaches the infastructure for handing numeric data from delay embeddings.
