**DynamicalSystems.jl** is an [award-winning](https://dsweb.siam.org/The-Magazine/Article/winners-of-the-dsweb-2018-software-contest) Julia software library for dynamical systems, nonlinear dynamics, deterministic chaos, and nonlinear timeseries analysis.
It is part of [JuliaDynamics](https://juliadynamics.github.io/JuliaDynamics/), an organization dedicated to creating high quality scientific software.

To learn how to use this library please see [Getting started](@ref) below, and subsequently, the [Contents](@ref) page to get an overview of all offered functionality of **DynamicalSystems.jl**.

!!! info "Latest news"
    A new [short-length tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJqOGsKQti8) is available for DynamicalSystems.jl. It gets you up to speed with the basic things you need to know to use the library! 


!!! tip "Star us on GitHub!"
    If you have found this library useful, please consider starring it on [GitHub](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DynamicalSystems.jl).
    This gives us an accurate lower bound of the (satisfied) user count.

## Getting started
**DynamicalSystems.jl** is a collection of Julia packages bundled together under a single package `DynamicalSystems`. To install this bundle you can do:
```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add("DynamicalSystems")
```

This "Getting started" section is also available as an introductory [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJqOGsKQti8) for those that prefer videos over text!

The individual packages that compose `DynamicalSystems` interact flawlessly with each other because of the following two structures:

1. The [`DynamicalSystem`](@ref) represents a dynamical system with known dynamic rule ``f``. The system can be in discrete time (often called a map), ``\vec{u}_{n+1} = \vec{f}(\vec{u}_n, p, n)``, or in continuous time (often called an ordinary differential equation) ``\frac{d\vec{u}}{dt} = \vec{f}(\vec{u}, p, t)``. In both cases ``u`` is the _state_ of the dynamical system and ``p`` a parameter container. You should have a look at the page [Dynamical System Definition](@ref) for how to create this object. A list of several pre-defined systems exists in the [Predefined Dynamical Systems](@ref) page.
2. Numerical data, that can represent measured experiments, sampled trajectories of dynamical systems, or just sets in the state space, are represented by [`Dataset`](@ref), which is a container of equally-sized data points. Timeseries in **DynamicalSystems.jl** are represented by the already existing `Vector` type of the Julia language.

These core structures `DynamicalSystem, Dataset` are used throughout the package to do useful calculations often used in the field of nonlinear dynamics and chaos.
For example, using [`lyapunovspectrum`](@ref) and [`DynamicalSystem`](@ref) gives you the Lyapunov exponents of a dynamical system with known equations of motion.
Alternatively, by using [`lyapunov_from_data`](@ref) and [`Dataset`](@ref) you can approximate the maximum Lyapunov exponent of a measured trajectory or a reconstructed set resulting from [`embed`](@ref).

All things possible in **DynamicalSystems.jl** are listed in the [Contents](@ref) page. For transparency, the packages and versions used to build the documentation you are reading now are:

```@setup MAIN
using CairoMakie
include("../style.jl")
```

```@example MAIN
using Pkg
Pkg.status([
    "DelayEmbeddings", "RecurrenceAnalysis",
    "DynamicalSystemsBase", "ChaosTools",
    "Entropies",];
    mode = PKGMODE_MANIFEST, io=stdout
)
```

### Tutorials
Tutorials for **DynamicalSystems.jl** exist in the form of [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/JuliaDynamics/tree/master/tutorials).

In addition, there are two video tutorials hosted on YouTube. The first one is short, gives you the basic idea, and is intended for people already familiar with nonlinear dynamics:

```

The second is much longer and also explains concepts of nonlinear dynamics:

```

!!! info "Introductory textbooks"
    Our library assumes some basic knowledge of nonlinear dynamics and complex systems.

    If you are new to the field but want to learn more, we can suggest the following textbooks as introductions:
    * Chaos in Dynamical Systems - E. Ott
    * Nonlinear Time series Analysis - H. Kantz & T. Schreiber


### Advanced Installation
Notice that for targeted usage of `DynamicalSystems` (e.g. you only need a specific function like [`lyapunovspectrum`](@ref) or [`rqa`](@ref)),
you don't have to install the entire `DynamicalSystems` suite. You can leave with only installing the necessary package that exports
the function you need. You see this information prefacing the function. E.g. for `rqa` you will see `RecurrenceAnalysis.rqa`, which
means that you need to install `RecurrenceAnalysis` to use it.

## Our Goals
**DynamicalSystems.jl** was created with three goals in mind.
The first was to fill the missing gap of a high quality and general purpose software for nonlinear dynamics, which can make the field of nonlinear dynamics accessible and reproducible.
The second goal was to create a useful _library_ where students and scientists from different fields may come and learn about methods of nonlinear dynamics.

The third goal was to fundamentally change the perception of the role of code in both scientific education as well as research.
It is rarely the case that real, _runnable_ code is shown in the classroom, because it is often long and messy.
This is especially hurtful for nonlinear dynamics, a field where computer-assisted exploration is critical.
And published work in this field fares even worse, with the overwhelming majority of published research not sharing the code used to create the paper.
This makes reproducing these papers difficult, while some times straight-out impossible.

To achieve these goals we made **DynamicalSystems.jl** so that it is:

1. **Transparent**: extra care is taken so that the source code of all functions is clear and easy to follow, while remaining as small and concise as possible.
2. **Intuitive**: a software simple to use and understand makes experimentation easier.
3. **Easy to extend**: this makes contributions more likely, and can motivate researchers to implement their method here, instead of leaving it in a cryptic script stored in some data server, never-to-be-published with the paper.
4. **Reliable**: the algorithm implementations are tested extensively.
5. **Well-documented**: all implemented algorithms provide a high-level scientific description of their functionality in their documentation string as well as references to scientific papers.
6. **General**: all algorithms work just as well with any system, whether it is a simple continuous chaotic system, like the Lorenz model, or a high dimensional discrete system like coupled standard maps.
7. **Performant**: written entirely in Julia, and taking advantage of some of the best packages within the language, **DynamicalSystems.jl** is _really fast_.
